# PART 1: STEP-BY-STEP — WHERE WE ACTUALLY START

## Step 0: Decide the order (this is now locked)

**Order we will follow:**

1. Firebase project
2. Firestore database + collections
3. Sample data entry
4. Android app setup
5. Read-only data flow (Firestore → App)
6. UI screens
7. Admin panel
8. Extras (notifications, payments)

We are starting at **1**.

---

## Step 1: Create Firebase project

1. Open your browser
2. Go to **[https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)**
3. Click **“Add project”**
4. Project name
   Example:
   `PCEA-Imani-Church`
5. Click **Continue**
6. Google Analytics

   * You can **disable it** for now (not needed)
7. Click **Create project**
8. Wait for Firebase to finish setup
9. Click **Continue**

At this point, you have a Firebase project. Nothing else yet.

---

## Step 2: Enable Firestore (the database)

1. In the left sidebar, click **Build → Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database**
3. Choose **Start in test mode**

   * This allows quick development
   * We will lock security rules later
4. Choose a **location**

   * Closest to Kenya is usually `europe-west` (this is fine)
5. Click **Enable**

Now the database exists.

Important truth:
Firestore does **not** force schemas. *You* must enforce discipline.

---

## Step 3: Create collections (no app yet)

You will manually create collections one by one.

Click **“Start collection”**

### Collection 1: `sermons`

Add your first document manually.

Fields:

* title → string
* preacher → string
* description → string
* coverImageUrl → string (can be empty for now)
* datePreached → timestamp
* durationMinutes → number
* videoUrl → string (optional)
* audioUrl → string (optional)
* language → string (`"en"`)
* createdAt → timestamp

Save.

Add **2–3 sermons**. Realistic ones. Not “test1”.

---

### Collection 2: `events`

Fields:

* title → string
* dateTime → timestamp
* location → string
* description → string
* category → string
* createdAt → timestamp

Add at least 2 events.

---

### Collection 3: `word_of_week`

Fields:

* book → string
* chapter → number
* verse → string (e.g. `"1–3"`)
* text → string
* startDate → timestamp
* endDate → timestamp
* language → string

Only **one active** record should overlap dates.

---

### Collection 4: `announcements`

Fields:

* title → string
* message → string
* startDate → timestamp
* endDate → timestamp
* createdAt → timestamp

---

### Collection 5: `notes` (empty for now)

We’ll use it later.

Stop here.
**Do not touch the app yet.**

---

# PART 2: FULL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (REFERENCE DOCUMENT)
